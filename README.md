### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a very challenging one especially because I used vanilla JavaScript. I couldn't do the drag and drop feature with mobile touch. I learned a lot about new array methods and state management. Overall, I'm proud of what it finally turned out to be.
